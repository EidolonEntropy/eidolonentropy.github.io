										<p>"First of all, I would like to give a massive thank you to Battalia. I had fallen behind in school and as the quarter's end neared, I had to shift all focus to completing all the missing work I had, rendering me unable to complete my parts (1-2). She then took what I had finished/planned and completed the parts for me and I cannot thank her enough. Here, as the scene opens we see a spider, nicknamed SpÏder, just chilling in their web. The reason why I had this occur was because I thought it'd be a fun way to introduce/begin the MAP as it plays off the title and actually has it in the web. When planning the parts, I also wanted to build up some spooky tension, especially the one created by Part 1's audio. Thus why in Part 1 it slowly pans away from the spider to only show an empty field waving in the wind while a deer, jokingly nicknamed Louis by Battalia and I, stands there, hopefully creating an unnerving feeling in viewers."<br>(Continued in the next page...)</p>

										<p>"As the deer enters the forest, I wanted to continue to play into this unnerving feeling, but make it scarier-more shocking to hopefully create some terror in the viewers in the good name of Halloween. So, I planned to have the deer trot through the forest a bit, playing off the chiller music to create a more relaxed mood so that when the shadowy figure, a formerly-human, cursed entity being punished for their crimes (note: they are not supposed to be a representation of a a w/n/d/g/o), suspense is recreated, but hopefully in a stronger manner. And as a result, when the deer is suddenly killed there is a strong feeling of shock instilled."</p>

The smell of mildew never left his nose since he descended the stairs—which as he shimmied his way to the breaker box, it occurred to him he should probably tell Henson about the mold problem before it gets topside. It was bad luck that brought him here, what were the odds the storm would knock out the power lines and the asset would escape containment? The rest of his colleagues opted to stay on watch duty in case they sighted   i&nbsp;t   while he and Kicks backed up the power. Cowards. He had split up with his partner to run a gen cord down to the breakers while Kicks went to look for the gasoline generator in the garage. Upon opening the box, it appeared the breakers had been tampered with.... That couldn’t be right. Wasn’t he the only one who had access to the basement key? <br><i>T&nbsp;h&nbsp;u&nbsp;d&nbsp;.</i><br>"An old grandfather clock lay crippled on the floor behind him. Were there rats down here?

So, although these two would never meet, and likely the canon-timeline Noir will never know Blanc existed, I wanted to play with Blanc representing Noir's potential to turn to the dark, that he's still human, and if it all goes wrong, Blanc can rise again."</p>

										<p>"When I was looking through the parts for the first time, part 11 really 'caught my eye'. The music box-like theme really reminded me of a puppet theatre or circus and something related to amusement parks. This was also an experiment with stylization and designing, to fit the atmosphere and theme of the part.<br>"The plot, where a puppeteer plays with their puppet came to my mind and I decided to use Static (white-eyed wolf) for it. He is a robot, and he has his own AI - Adrie (aka Adrenaline; black wolf). The idea of Adrie controlling Static, who is just entertaining people, was something I came up with nearly immediately. Adrie is the representation of Static's darker side, the gloomy depths of his consciousness, his deepest fears."</p>

They then changed Arctic's name to Ribbon. After many years, Ribbon became the new leader of the group. Unfortunately, the Icewing's Queen found them and forced them to hide somewhere else.

										<p>"Apocalypse is, well, was the god of everything, simply named 'The Creator'. He had a god named Surge at his side, who took care of the things The Creator might have missed. He was in a higher up group with three other gods. A snake named Sol, a dragon named Eliatrope, and a wingless dragon named Eon.<br>Eon was extremely jealous of Surge's position, and plotted to take him out. He crafted something dark and evil, which he aptly named 'Corruption'.<br>Unfortunately, The Creator found it first. He walked into the trap Eon set up for Surge, and the Corruption quickly took over him, turning him darker and more red, compared to his original shades of blue. His eyes turned from green to red, as well as the normally white part of his eyes turning pitch black.<br>He trapped and killed Surge by ripping off his head to wear as a mask. He turned to Sol, Eliatrope and Eon, all of which were horrified at the state of their god. The Creator then took a new name. Apocalypse."</p>

Doggo was the one who was closest with said character, so she goes after her with no hesitation. Doggo ends up getting shot with some magic intensifier in hopes that she'll become unstable and turn on her friends, but instead an unconscious spirit inside her takes over, and she snaps."</p>

										<p>"So I had the amazing opportunity to have Part X! When I found this Map I knew I had to join, when I had looked at the parts, nothing really stood out to me, but the second part X had started playing, my brain immediately had started going wild over it. When I had woken up I saw that my idea was accepted I had immediately started getting to work!<br>"My whole part is that you had entered in to an abandoned asylum, when you got there you see these 3 little girls, the walls are dripping with blood, there was this weird smell of dried up blood and guts, it was as if someone had died there, you quickly try and rush to the exit but you are stopped by the 3 little girls. They start singing they are wearing masks and it looks like their in a cult. You get knocked out by the one in the ponytail while your knocked out you have a vision. It’s the same girl who knocked you out, it seems like she was being forced in to their cult, you then quickly wake up and you see the girls again this time they disappear in to dust. You start freaking out, all of a sudden you get pulled upside down and you see the girl with a ponytail again, but this time she looks different, this time she has long arms and legs that had reached the floor, it seemed like her hair had been pulled out, her eyes where bright pink and orange and it seems as she was no longer wearing a mask. This time her eyes wear stitched together to look like she is wearing a mask but she is actually not, there were pieces of all kinds of skin sewed around her eyes, and chunks of her mouth gone to form a smile. She then without hesitation, she GRABS YOU AND BITES IN TO YOUR SKIN, slowly eating you outside in. You then lay there on the ground helpless and then you slowly die a slow and painful death.<br>"I hope you enjoyed my part! I had a lot of fun thinking and making it!"</p>

			<h5>You're in for a treat.</h5>
			<p>What better way to celebrate Halloween than an animation set to the song that embodies the dark, spooky nature of the holiday?</p>
			<p>Way back in mid-2019, Jaxorri and I collaborated on hosting this MAP, with the call originally going up on their channel. Unfortunately, we did not receive enough parts in time, so this year, I rehosted it individually, and with a few tweaks to the original call. This time around, enough parts were accounted for to create this outstanding final product!</p>
			<p>A huge thank you to all the participants, direct and indirect! Only your exceptional participation made this possible!</p>
